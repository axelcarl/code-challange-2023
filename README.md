# VALUECHECKER CODE CHALLANGE 2023

This is my submission to your code challange!

To get all required modules, run  "npm init".

jest.js is used for unit-testing.

data.txt is just a copy of the example operators specified in the
google document.

## Performance

Some performance was not captured in order to make the code
easy to follow and test, however if performance was an issue for
larger samples of data, the operations could be done without first
creating objects of all the operators.

## Parsing

I went with a parsing-solution as no prefered solution was
mentioned, however a solution where the data already is contained in
an array / a database would make for a less "hacky" script.
